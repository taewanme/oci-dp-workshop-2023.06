Most database breaches involve the use of compromised user accounts - that means that every time you remove an unnecessary privilege from an account you shrink the attack surface area and minimize the blast radius in the event of a successful compromise. Privilege Analysis gives you an alternative to traditional privilege attestation where you just print a list of users and their roles/privileges for review. With Privilege Analysis, you can enrich those reports with  information on privileges that are assigned, but not being used over a period of time.

It is made up of a curated set of open source components – many that you may already use and trust, and some that were written specifically to pull together all of the pieces that make Verrazzano a cohesive and easy to use platform.Verrazzano includes the following capabilities:-Hybrid and multicluster workload management-Special handling for WebLogic, Coherence, and Helidon applications-Multicluster infrastructure management-Integrated and pre-wired application monitoring-Integrated security-DevOps and GitOps enablementBob’s Books sample application consists of three main parts:-A back-end “order processing” application, which is a Java EE application with REST services and a very simple JSP UI, which stores data in a MySQL database. This application runs on WebLogic Server.-A front-end web store “Robert’s Books”, which is a general book seller. This is implemented as a Helidon microservice, which gets book data from Coherence, uses a Coherence cache store to persist data for the order manager, and has a React web UI.-A front-end web store “Bobby’s Books”, which is a specialty children’s book store. This is implemented as a Helidon microservice, which gets book data from a (different) Coherence cache store, interfaces directly with the order manager, and has a JSF web UI running on WebLogic Server.",

        "description": "Enterprise textual data has significant value related to core business activities and their customers. To gain business and customer insights effectively and at scale from this text data, natural language processing capabilities are needed. For example, identifying key requirements in RFPs to respond effectively or understand customer perception of their products to address gaps.  Some core language processing capabilities include detecting languages, translating content, extracting key elements, classifying intent and detecting the sentiment expressed in the text. These capabilities are typically machine learning algorithms custom built, tuned by Data Scientists and productized for use in applications. Doing this is a time consuming and expensive proposition. OCI Language service reduces this time and effort, by providing key language processing capabilities via production ready REST APIs. The service enables applications to automate sophisticated text analysis at scale without needing ML expertise. The service functionality is implemented with pre-trained ML models which are often useful. They may also be further customized to understand the language patterns of the customer’s context by providing additional data.These capabilities are expected of and provided by all hyperscale public clouds.",

Data is captured from various sources into a landing zone in object storage. This data is then processed (cleansed, transformed, and optimized) and stored in a gold zone on object storage. Once the data is curated, it is loaded into an Autonomous Database where it is analyzed by many (and varied) members of the user community - from data analysts to data scientists. These users will take advantage of a variety of Autonomous Database capabilities: advanced Oracle SQL to glean customer insights, Oracle Machine Learning to predict churn, and Oracle Spatial and Graph to provide targeted promotions.",

One way to deploy an APM Java agent in a Docker container-enabled Kubernetes cluster, is to first, provision the APM Java agent in the location where docker image was originally created, second, build a new Docker image with the APM Java agent, and third, push the image to the registry. You can then configure Kubernetes to use the new Docker image to enable the APM agent in the pods.However, this method assumes you have administrator access to the Docker working directory to recreate the image, which may not always be the case. In this workshop, we will use an alternative approach, to provision the APM Java agent in a file system mounted in the Oracle Cloud, and deploy it to the Kubernetes cluster, without updating the Docker image.",

Next you will run the auto partitioning validate API to confirm that the table meets auto partitioning requirements. Then execute the auto partitioning recommend task in report-only mode. The task will build a partitioned copy of the table and compare performance before vs. after partitioning. Finally, use the apply API to implement the auto partition recommendation. The APART table will be  transformed into an ONLINE ALTER TABLE operation so that the production workload is not interrupted.",

Autonomous Database comes with 5 preconfigured database services, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, TP and TPURGENT. The services control the priority of the sessions when the system is under resource pressure and some control the parallel degree used. By default, queries will execute serially when connected to the TP, TPURGENT and LOW services.Users can specify a parallel degree on an object or uses optimizer hints to trigger parallel execution to be used when connected to the TP and TPURGENT services. Queries will be automatically executed in parallel when sessions are connected to the HIGH and MEDIUM services.There are cases where we see a lot of application users misusing the consumer groups to their advantage and in doing so leading to performance overhead in the database.So here in this blog we are going to show how to restrict users to certain consumer groups using database vault built into autonomous database.One of the many security capabilities built into Autonomous Database is Database Vault. Database Vault implements powerful, unique security controls that restrict access to application data by privileged database users and enforce context-aware policies for data access by any user. Database Vault reduces the risk of insider and outside threats and addresses common compliance requirements.",

Data is captured from various sources into a landing zone in object storage. This data is then processed (cleansed, transformed, and optimized) and stored in a gold zone on object storage. Once the data is curated, it is loaded into an Autonomous Database where it is analyzed by many (and varied) members of the user community - from data analysts to data scientists. These users will take advantage of a variety of Autonomous Database capabilities: advanced Oracle SQL to glean customer insights, Oracle Machine Learning to predict churn, and Oracle Spatial and Graph to provide targeted promotions.",

        "description": "The feature type system allows data scientists to separate the concept of how data is represented physically from what the data actually measures. That is, the data can have feature types that classify the data based on what it represents and not how the data is stored in memory. Each set of data can have multiple feature types through a system of multiple inheritances. As a concrete example, an organization that sells cars might have a set of data that represents the purchase price of a car, that is the wholesale price. You could have a feature set of wholesale_price, car_price, USD, and continuous. All default feature types have methods for creating summary statistics and a plot to represent the data. This allows you to have summary information for each feature of your dataset while only using a single command. However, the default feature types may not provide the exact details needed in your specific use case. Therefore, feature types have been designed with expandability in mind. When creating a new feature type, the summary statistics and plots that are specific to your feature type can be customized.The feature type system works at the Pandas dataframe and series levels. This allows you to create summary information across all of your data and at the same time dig into the specifics of one feature.The feature type framework comes with some common feature types. However, the power of using feature types is that you can easily create your own and apply them to your specific data. You don't need to try to represent your data in a synthetic way that does not match the nature of your data. This framework allows you to create methods that validate whether the data fits the specifications of your organization. For example, for a medical record type, you could create methods to validate that the data is properly formatted. You can also have the system generate warnings to sure the data is valid as a whole or create graphs for summary plots.The framework allows you to create and assign multiple feature types. For example, a medical record id could also have a feature type id and the integer feature type. It also allows you to customize summary statistics, plots and correlations. Select columns based on feature types.Feature type warnings are used for rapid validation of the data. For example, the wholesale_price might have a method that ensures that the value is a positive number because you can't purchase a car with negative money. The car_price feature type may have a check to ensure that it is within a reasonable price range. USD can check the value to make sure that it represents a valid US dollar amount. It can't have values below one cent. The continuous feature type is the default feature type and it represents the way the data is stored internally.The feature type validators are a set of is_* methods, where * is generally the name of the feature type. For example, the method .is_wholesale_price() can create a boolean Pandas series that indicates what values meet the validation criteria. It allows you to quickly identify which values need to be filtered or require future examination into problems in the data pipeline. The feature type validators can be as complex as they need to be. For example, they might take a client ID and call an API to validate that each client ID is active.",

Further, R users can invoke powerful in-database machine learning algorithms from a native R API and deploy user-defined R functions in database-spawned and controlled R engines - all in support of R-based solution development.OML4R is for those looking to process data in place without moving the data out of the database. This allows you to leverage the high-performance database to process data for data science and machine learning solutions. This workshop guides you through using various OML4R features for data exploration and preparation, and machine learning modeling using in-database algorithms.",

        "description": "About 80% of the world’s data is in an unstructured format: Video files, PDFs, spreadsheets, images, and so on. Many of these unstructured documents contain plain text written in prose. Even databases have many semi-structured tables because they contain textual fields, such as descriptions or customer support requests. Dealing with large quantities of text data is a complex task, but this information is valuable! What if we could apply state-of-the-art AI models to unstructured data to extract insights from it? Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) now offers several AI services that allow you to harness the power of artificial intelligence. They offer pre-trained models ready for you to use and easy-to-train custom models that any developer can tweak. AI Services are geared toward developers, and you don’t need to be an expert data scientist to consume them. In this workshop, we describe a pattern where we use OCI Language, one of our AI services, as part of an enrichment pipeline that allows you to ingest unstructured textual data and extract insights from it to analyze and visualize insights in OAC.",

The React Frontend calls the APIs that are built using SpringBoot, and the user is able to clone the repository locally to make changes that will reflect in the database. This workshop also showcases CORS in API Gateway so only allowed origins are able to access the API.",

MicroProfile APIs provide the foundation for developing microservices applications by adopting the subset of Java EE and Jakarta EE standards and extending them to address typical microservices patterns. Oracle delivers an open-source project that delivers an easy to adopt framework for microservices in Java called Helidon. Helidon is available in two editions – Helidon SE and Helidon MP. While Helidon SE is a simple, reactive, and lightweight framework, Helidon MP offers the developer community the ease of implementing MicroProfile specifications. Helidon offers an easy path for Java EE developers to enter the microservices development community.  Please join our hands-on-lab to experience an introduction to Helidon MP. You will gain first-hand knowledge on how to get started with your first Helidon MP application development project.",

Oracle Transaction Manager for Microservices (MicroTx) provides a transaction coordination microservice to maintain consistency in the state of various databases participating in a transaction. Transaction Manager for Microservices supports several distributed transaction protocols, such as XA, Long Running Actions (LRA), and Try-Confirm/Cancel (TCC). It supports distributed transactions across polyglot microservices, such as Java, node.js, C/C++ and PL/SQL. You can deploy Transaction Manager for Microservices in Kubernetes or Docker environments running in cloud or in your own data center. It comes pre-integrated with tools such as Jaeger, Kiali, Prometheus, and Grafana, which enables you to perform various advanced and efficient troubleshooting and data management operations, such as data visualization, data monitoring, transaction tracing, and so on.",

Won't it be great to have a tool that automates the data collection of access affinity to the tables and objects in the database schema? By analyzing the affinity closely, and applying graph clustering techniques using the Oracle Graph Database, advise for schema refactoring is provided. It is an iterative process to arrive at a meaningful cluster that the development team can take advantage of by defining bounded contexts in coding the applications. Splitting the schema and bounding access of a cluster of tables and objects to microservices results in the use of APIs or messaging to communicate between microservices.",

Oracle Database Vault is a security-enhancement tool that provides an additional layer of security by restricting access to sensitive data and preventing unauthorized users from accessing or manipulating it. By combining the self-managing capabilities of Oracle Autonomous Database with the security features of Oracle Database Vault, organizations can benefit from both enhanced performance and improved security.One of the key features of Oracle Autonomous Database is its ability to automatically tune itself for optimal performance. This is achieved through the use of machine learning algorithms that continually analyze database workloads and make adjustments to the database configuration in real-time. This allows Oracle Autonomous Database to deliver consistently high performance, even as workloads and data volumes change over time.Overall, Oracle Autonomous Database and Oracle Database Vault are valuable tools for organizations looking to optimize their database performance and improve security. The combination of these two technologies allows organizations to take advantage of the self-managing capabilities of Oracle Autonomous Database, while also protecting sensitive data with the security features of Oracle Database Vault.This hands-on-lab is designed to help customers understand how they can migrate an on-premises application to Oracle Cloud and take advantage of the security features available in Oracle Autonomous Database. Oracle Database Vault can help customers secure their data from privileged users and protect application credentials from being misused or abused. In this lab, you will migrate an on-premises application to Autonomous Database and further secure access to the data with Oracle Database Vault.",

        "description": "Redacting is the process of obscuring or removing sensitive information from data. In REST calls, redaction is useful to protect sensitive information, such as passwords or personal data, from being transmitted or stored in plain text. ORDS, or Oracle REST Data Services, provides a way to redact REST calls in a secure and efficient manner.ORDS enables redaction by using the \"mask\" and \"replace\" functions. The \"mask\" function masks the data by replacing it with a specified character, such as asterisks, while the \"replace\" function replaces the data with a specified string. ORDS also provides options to configure the scope of redaction, such as a specific column, a range of columns, or a regular expression pattern.Redaction in ORDS can be implemented in two ways: at the request level or at the response level. When redacting at the request level, ORDS obscures the sensitive data before it is transmitted to the server, ensuring that the data is not stored in its original form. When redacting at the response level, ORDS obscures the sensitive data after it has been retrieved from the server and before it is sent to the client. This approach is useful when the data needs to be stored in its original form but should not be visible to the client.By providing a flexible and secure way to redact REST calls, ORDS enables and allows administrators to configure the scope of redaction and implement it at the request or response level, depending on their security requirements.",

        "description": "Author: Žiga Vaupot, Oracle ACE Pro - Business Intelligence, QubixVision is a self-service AI Service within OCI, which applies computer vision to analyze image-based content. It allows developers easily integrate pre-trained models into their applications with APIs or custom training models to meet their specific use cases. In this workshop, we will explore how to use Vision AI service to create a custom-built model to detect pneumonia infected lungs on a fresh dataset of X-ray images. Oracle Analytics is then used as a front-end tool to use the model to classify new images for pneumonia. What to expect to see in this workshop? In the first place, we will demonstrate and explore the whole process from “plain” X-ray image to identifying pneumonia infected lungs using OCI services:• Gathering and storing images to OCI Object Storage.• Labeling images depending on whether they represent normal or pneumonia infected lungs using Data Labeling service.• Building and training an image classification model using OCI Vision.• Registering an OCI Vision model with Oracle Analytics.• Applying a model in Oracle Analytics’ Data Flows. • Visualizing everything at the end by using Oracle Analytics Data Visualization.Why is this relevant? Firstly, it shows the flexibility and usability of the OCI ecosystem, specifically Data Lakehouse services. Secondly, the whole process (with exception of data labeling which is done programmatically) is code-less, with not too many steps in the process, and the process itself is really very simple to use. This implies possibilities which can be explored by much wider range of users comparing to the situation today, where all depends on skilled developers and data scientists. And the bottom line, this can have very positive impact on business.",

This breakthrough innovation overcomes the historical challenges that developers have faced when building applications, either when using the relational model or when using the document model.JSON Relational Duality helps to converge benefits of both document and relational worlds. Developers now get the flexibility and data access benefits of the JSON document model, plus the storage efficiency and power of the relational model. The new feature that enables this convergence is called JSON Relational Duality View.Interacting with your Oracle Database with HTTPS and REST APIs can be as simple as picking the objects in your database you want to start working with.Oracle REST Data Service (ORDS) includes a feature known as ‘AutoREST,’ where one or more objects are enabled, and REST API endpoints are automatically published. For example, a TABLE can be enabled for GET, PUT, POST, DELETE operations to get one or more rows, insert or update rows, delete rows, or even batchload multiple rows in a single request. This feature has been enhanced for 23c to include similar REST access for JSON-Relational duality views.",

ADW provides high performance when querying external data at scale. Finally, ADW provides multi-language support to process Data Lakes such as SQL, Python, R, and REST.The labs in this workshop walk you through all the steps that you need to build and access the Data Lake (Oracle Object Storage buckets) using Autonomous Database (ADB). First, you set-up the workshop environment and create the necessary resources such as a compartment, an Autonomous Database instance, and Oracle Object Storage resources. Next, evolve object storage files into meaningful business entities by defining the metadata for external data in ADB using several methods such as programmatically using PL/SQL scripts, using the Database Actions user interface in ADB, or by synchronizing with Data Catalogs (to derive the metadata) such as OCI Data Catalog and AWS Glue. Next, you can gain insights from the Data Lakes by querying data that lives in your Oracle Database and combine that with data that is stored in your Oracle Object Storage buckets using regular SQL select statements that includes joined tables. You also move data to Object Storage buckets by exporting your datasets. Finally, you query your data using the SQL Worksheet.",
