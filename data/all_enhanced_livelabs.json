This lab will show you how to use the Helidon Micro Profile framework to REST enable existing (or new) code and add security, configuration management and handle the new types of fault that come in from distributed processing. You will see how to easily connect to a database, create communicating microservices, and also how you can easily connect to a microservice from existing code, demonstrating how you can split part of a monolith into a microservice.

To gain business and customer insights effectively and at scale from this text data, natural language processing capabilities are needed. For example, identifying key requirements in RFPs to respond effectively or understand customer perception of their products to address gaps.  Some core language processing capabilities include detecting languages, translating content, extracting key elements, classifying intent and detecting the sentiment expressed in the text. These capabilities are typically machine learning algorithms custom built, tuned by Data Scientists and productized for use in applications. Doing this is a time consuming and expensive proposition. OCI Language service reduces this time and effort, by providing key language processing capabilities via production ready REST APIs. The service enables applications to automate sophisticated text analysis at scale without needing ML expertise. The service functionality is implemented with pre-trained ML models which are often useful. They may also be further customized to understand the language patterns of the customer\u2019s context by providing additional data.These capabilities are expected of and provided by all hyperscale public clouds.", "duration": "2 hours", "published_time": "2019-04-16T01:47:21", "title_ko": "Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Language \uc2dc\uc791\ud558\uae30", "description_ko": "\uc5d4\ud130\ud504\ub77c\uc774\uc988 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \ud575\uc2ec \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \ud65c\ub3d9 \ubc0f \uace0\uac1d\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uac00\uce58\ub97c \uac00\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \ubc0f \uace0\uac1d \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8\ub85c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\ubcf4\ud558\ub824\uba74 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ucc98\ub9ac \uae30\ub2a5\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4, RFP\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \ud30c\uc545\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\uc751\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc81c\ud488\uc758 \uace0\uac1d \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \ud30c\uc545\ud558\uc5ec \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubd80 \ud575\uc2ec \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ucc98\ub9ac \uae30\ub2a5\uc5d0\ub294 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uac10\uc9c0, \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \ubcc0\ud658, \uc8fc\uc694 \uc694\uc18c \ucd94\ucd9c, \uc758\ub3c4 \ubd84\ub958, \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ub41c \uac10\uc815 \uac10\uc9c0\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uae30\ub2a5\uc740 \uba38\uc2e0 \ub7ec\ub2dd \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uacfc\ud559\uc790\uac00 \ub9de\ucda4 \uad6c\ucd95 \ubc0f \ud29c\ub2dd\ud558\uace0 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uc0dd\uc0b0\ud654\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \uac78\ub9ac\uace0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4dc\ub294 \uc81c\uc548\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Is it the amount of overtaking? The battle for the number 1 position? The weather conditions? Or are we missing some other element that we don\u2019t quite understand yet?The answer to these questions lies hidden in data: 70 years of racing data, to be precise.In this two-hour workshop, you\u2019ll have the opportunity to experiment with racing data using a combination of techniques to look for the answer.You\u2019ll extract critical pieces of information that define the essence of each race, and visualize races and seasons using advanced techniques to determine how great each race is based on established criteria.Experience firsthand what challenges data scientists. You\u2019ll learn the basics of analytics and machine learning and become familiar with the entire process, from data preparation and visualization to model building, prediction, and evaluation.So come join us in this fun workshop and help solve the challenge!No previous analytics or data science experience is required.

It will then guide you through the process of creating a fleet, which is the primary collection with which you interact when using JMS and contains Managed Instances that share a common management approach, followed by the process of deploying a simple Java Application in an OCI compute instance or Windows OS. Next, you will learn how to set up the Management Agent on your host machine (also known as a Managed Instance in JMS) to monitor your Java application and view it inside a fleet in JMS. Later, you will learn how to install and configure Management Gateway on an on-premises host and have another on-premises host proxy through it to communicate with OCI network and JMS. Finally, you will see a simple example of setting up a Java Application in a Docker container and monitoring it using JMS.", "duration": "2 hours, 20 minutes", "published_time": "2019-05-21T08:46:36", "title_ko": "Java Management Service\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec Java Runtime, \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158 \ubc0f \uad00\ub9ac \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4 \uc778\ubca4\ud1a0\ub9ac \uad00\ub9ac", "description_ko": "\uc774 \uc6cc\ud06c\uc0f5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 OCI(Oracle Cloud Infrastructure)\uc5d0\uc11c JMS(Java Management Service)\ub97c \uc124\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uba3c\uc800 JMS \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uc2dc\uc791\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uc124\uc815\ud558\uace0 Tagging, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uadf8\ub8f9, \ub3d9\uc801 \uadf8\ub8f9 \ubc0f \uc815\ucc45\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ud544\uc694\ud55c OCI \ub9ac\uc18c\uc2a4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c \ud50c\ub9ac\ud2b8 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uc548\ub0b4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub294 JMS\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa8\uc74c\uc774\uba70 \uacf5\ud1b5 \uad00\ub9ac \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uacf5\uc720\ud558\ub294 \uad00\ub9ac \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uace0, OCI \ucef4\ud4e8\ud2b8 \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4 \ub610\ub294 Windows OS\uc5d0\uc11c \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c Java \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ubc30\uce58\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c \ud638\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(JMS\uc758 \uad00\ub9ac \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\ub77c\uace0\ub3c4 \ud568)\uc5d0\uc11c Management Agent\ub97c \uc124\uc815\ud558\uc5ec Java \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ud558\uace0 JMS\uc758 \ud50c\ub9ac\ud2b8 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubc30\uc6c1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub098\uc911\uc5d0 \uc628\ud504\ub808\ubbf8\uc2a4 \ud638\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uad00\ub9ac \uac8c\uc774\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc774\ub97c \uc124\uce58 \ubc0f \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc628\ud504\ub808\ubbf8\uc2a4 \ud638\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud504\ub85d\uc2dc\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec OCI \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ubc0f JMS\uc640 \ud1b5\uc2e0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubc30\uc6c1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c Docker \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\uc5d0 Java \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc124\uc815\ud558\uace0 JMS\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uc608\ub97c \ubcfc \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "duration_ko": "2\uc2dc\uac04 20\ubd84", "oci_products": "docker container,gateway,java application,jms,windows os", "key_phrase": "using jms,jms,java application,fleet,oci,java runtimes,managed instances inventory,java management servicethis workshop,using java management service,oracle cloud infrastructure"}

To gain business and customer insights effectively and at scale from this data, vision capabilities are needed. For example, identifying key requirements to understand customer perception of their products to address gaps. Some core capabilities include classifying images & documents, detecting objects, text & languages and extracting table information from the data. These capabilities are typically machine learning algorithms custom built, tuned by Data Scientists and productized for use in applications. Doing this is a time consuming and expensive proposition. OCI Vision Service reduces time and effort to perform Vision tasks like image classification, object detection, text detection, document AI etc by providing key vision capabilities via production-ready REST APIs.

This enables automatic OpenTracing instrumentation, and metrics collection that are used to provide full, end-to-end monitoring and diagnostics for the application. One way to deploy an APM Java agent in a Docker container-enabled Kubernetes cluster, is to first, provision the APM Java agent in the location where docker image was originally created, second, build a new Docker image with the APM Java agent, and third, push the image to the registry. You can then configure Kubernetes to use the new Docker image to enable the APM agent in the pods.However, this method assumes you have administrator access to the Docker working directory to recreate the image, which may not always be the case. In this workshop, we will use an alternative approach, to provision the APM Java agent in a file system mounted in the Oracle Cloud, and deploy it to the Kubernetes cluster, without updating the Docker image.", "duration": "1 hour", "published_time": "2019-06-23T10:07:26", "title_ko": "Oracle Application Performance Monitoring\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec Kubernetes\uc5d0 \ubc30\uce58\ub41c WebLogic \uc11c\ubc84\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd94\uc801 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1", "description_ko": "\uc774 \uc6cc\ud06c\uc0f5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Oracle Application Performance Monitoring(APM) \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 WebLogic-on-Kubernetes\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc54c\uc544\ubd05\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc804\uccb4 \uc5d4\ub4dc \ud22c \uc5d4\ub4dc \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \ubc0f \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9 OpenTracing \uacc4\uce21 \ubc0f \uce21\uc815 \uc9c0\ud45c \uc218\uc9d1\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Autonomous Database comes with 5 preconfigured database services, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, TP and TPURGENT. The services control the priority of the sessions when the system is under resource pressure and some control the parallel degree used. By default, queries will execute serially when connected to the TP, TPURGENT and LOW services.Users can specify a parallel degree on an object or uses optimizer hints to trigger parallel execution to be used when connected to the TP and TPURGENT services. Queries will be automatically executed in parallel when sessions are connected to the HIGH and MEDIUM services.There are cases where we see a lot of application users misusing the consumer groups to their advantage and in doing so leading to performance overhead in the database.So here in this blog we are going to show how to restrict users to certain consumer groups using database vault built into autonomous database.One of the many security capabilities built into Autonomous Database is Database Vault.

Data is captured from various sources into a landing zone in object storage. This data is then processed (cleansed, transformed, and optimized) and stored in a gold zone on object storage. Once the data is curated, it is loaded into an Autonomous Database where it is analyzed by many (and varied) members of the user community - from data analysts to data scientists.

{"id": 3193, "title": "Feature types for data exploration and validation", "url": "https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/dbpm/livelabs/run-workshop?p210_wid=3193", "type": "Hands-on", "description": "The feature type system allows data scientists to separate the concept of how data is represented physically from what the data actually measures. That is, the data can have feature types that classify the data based on what it represents and not how the data is stored in memory. Each set of data can have multiple feature types through a system of multiple inheritances. As a concrete example, an organization that sells cars might have a set of data that represents the purchase price of a car, that is the wholesale price. You could have a feature set of wholesale_price, car_price, USD, and continuous. All default feature types have methods for creating summary statistics and a plot to represent the data. This allows you to have summary information for each feature of your dataset while only using a single command. However, the default feature types may not provide the exact details needed in your specific use case. Therefore, feature types have been designed with expandability in mind. When creating a new feature type, the summary statistics and plots that are specific to your feature type can be customized.The feature type system works at the Pandas dataframe and series levels. This allows you to create summary information across all of your data and at the same time dig into the specifics of one feature.The feature type framework comes with some common feature types. However, the power of using feature types is that you can easily create your own and apply them to your specific data. You don't need to try to represent your data in a synthetic way that does not match the nature of your data. This framework allows you to create methods that validate whether the data fits the specifications of your organization. For example, for a medical record type, you could create methods to validate that the data is properly formatted. You can also have the system generate warnings to sure the data is valid as a whole or create graphs for summary plots.The framework allows you to create and assign multiple feature types. For example, a medical record id could also have a feature type id and the integer feature type. It also allows you to customize summary statistics, plots and correlations. Select columns based on feature types.Feature type warnings are used for rapid validation of the data. For example, the wholesale_price might have a method that ensures that the value is a positive number because you can't purchase a car with negative money. The car_price feature type may have a check to ensure that it is within a reasonable price range. USD can check the value to make sure that it represents a valid US dollar amount. It can't have values below one cent. The continuous feature type is the default feature type and it represents the way the data is stored internally.The feature type validators are a set of is_* methods, where * is generally the name of the feature type. For example, the method .is_wholesale_price() can create a boolean Pandas series that indicates what values meet the validation criteria. It allows you to quickly identify which values need to be filtered or require future examination into problems in the data pipeline. The feature type validators can be as complex as they need to be. For example, they might take a client ID and call an API to validate that each client ID is active.", "duration": "1 hour, 30 minutes", "published_time": "2020-07-08T20:01:32", "title_ko":

OML4R provides a database-centric environment for end-to-end analytical processes using R. Users invoke overloaded R functions on database-resident data for data exploration and preparation, which leverages the database as a high-performance computing environment. Further, R users can invoke powerful in-database machine learning algorithms from a native R API and deploy user-defined R functions in database-spawned and controlled R engines - all in support of R-based solution development.OML4R is for those looking to process data in place without moving the data out of the database. This allows you to leverage the high-performance database to process data for data science and machine learning solutions.

Many of these unstructured documents contain plain text written in prose. Even databases have many semi-structured tables because they contain textual fields, such as descriptions or customer support requests. Dealing with large quantities of text data is a complex task, but this information is valuable! What if we could apply state-of-the-art AI models to unstructured data to extract insights from it? Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) now offers several AI services that allow you to harness the power of artificial intelligence. They offer pre-trained models ready for you to use and easy-to-train custom models that any developer can tweak. AI Services are geared toward developers, and you don\u2019t need to be an expert data scientist to consume them. In this workshop, we describe a pattern where we use OCI Language, one of our AI services, as part of an enrichment pipeline that allows you to ingest unstructured textual data and extract insights from it to analyze and visualize insights in OAC.", "duration": "1 hour", "published_time": "2020-08-30T07:31:12", "title_ko": "OCI AI \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \ubc0f OAC\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac10\uc815 \ubd84\uc11d \uc218\ud589", "description_ko": "\ube44\ub514\uc624 \ud30c\uc77c, PDF, \uc2a4\ud504\ub808\ub4dc\uc2dc\ud2b8, \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ub4f1 \uc138\uacc4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc57d 80%\uac00 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ud615\uc2dd\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ubb38\uc11c \uc911 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc5d0\ub294 \uad6c\ubb38 \ubd84\uc11d\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc131\ub41c \uc77c\ubc18 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\ub294 \uc124\uba85\uc774\ub098 \uace0\uac1d \uc9c0\uc6d0 \uc694\uccad\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud544\ub4dc\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub9ce\uc740 \ubc18\uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ud14c\uc774\ube14\uc744 \uac00\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ub7c9\uc758 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc774 \uc815\ubcf4\ub294 \uac00\uce58\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 AI \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\uba74 \uc5b4\ub5a8\uae4c\uc694?

The MicroProfile specifications enable existing Java EE developers to leverage their existing skills and quickly transition them into developers of microservices. MicroProfile APIs provide the foundation for developing microservices applications by adopting the subset of Java EE and Jakarta EE standards and extending them to address typical microservices patterns. Oracle delivers an open-source project that delivers an easy to adopt framework for microservices in Java called Helidon. Helidon is available in two editions \u2013 Helidon SE and Helidon MP. While Helidon SE is a simple, reactive, and lightweight framework, Helidon MP offers the developer community the ease of implementing MicroProfile specifications.

This sample dataset is a collection of customers, stores, products, and orders used to manage the shopping cart. The PRODUCTS table includes columns such as image, price, and details. But there are other characteristics that customers would appreciate knowing about a product, such as colour, type of clothing, and department. In this lab, you will add these columns to the PRODUCTS table. You also learn how to add three new columns to the PRODUCTS table and create lookup tables for those new columns.Then, you learn to create database objects for your APEX application. This package contains functions and procedures to add products to the cart, remove products, create an order, clear the cart, and more. You also learn to create and use collections.You will also learn how to create database objects using Quick SQL and then view the objects in Database Actions.

Oracle Database Vault is a security-enhancement tool that provides an additional layer of security by restricting access to sensitive data and preventing unauthorized users from accessing or manipulating it. By combining the self-managing capabilities of Oracle Autonomous Database with the security features of Oracle Database Vault, organizations can benefit from both enhanced performance and improved security.One of the key features of Oracle Autonomous Database is its ability to automatically tune itself for optimal performance. This is achieved through the use of machine learning algorithms that continually analyze database workloads and make adjustments to the database configuration in real-time. This allows Oracle Autonomous Database to deliver consistently high performance, even as workloads and data volumes change over time.Overall, Oracle Autonomous Database and Oracle Database Vault are valuable tools for organizations looking to optimize their database performance and improve security. The combination of these two technologies allows organizations to take advantage of the self-managing capabilities of Oracle Autonomous Database, while also protecting sensitive data with the security features of Oracle Database Vault.This hands-on-lab is designed to help customers understand how they can migrate an on-premises application to Oracle Cloud and take advantage of the security features available in Oracle Autonomous Database. Oracle Database Vault can help customers secure their data from privileged users and protect application credentials from being misused or abused. In this lab, you will migrate an on-premises application to Autonomous Database and further secure access to the data with Oracle Database Vault.", "duration": "1 hour, 30 minutes", "published_time": "2022-04-14T09:53:59", "title_ko": "Oracle Autonomous Database\uc5d0\uc11c Oracle Database Vault\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub808\uac70\uc2dc \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158 \ubcf4\ud638", "description_ko": "ADB\ub294 Oracle Autonomous Database\uc758 \uc790\uccb4 \uad00\ub9ac \uae30\ub2a5\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 Oracle Database Vault\uc640\ub3c4 \ud1b5\ud569\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In REST calls, redaction is useful to protect sensitive information, such as passwords or personal data, from being transmitted or stored in plain text. ORDS, or Oracle REST Data Services, provides a way to redact REST calls in a secure and efficient manner.ORDS enables redaction by using the \"mask\" and \"replace\" functions. The \"mask\" function masks the data by replacing it with a specified character, such as asterisks, while the \"replace\" function replaces the data with a specified string. ORDS also provides options to configure the scope of redaction, such as a specific column, a range of columns, or a regular expression pattern.Redaction in ORDS can be implemented in two ways: at the request level or at the response level. When redacting at the request level, ORDS obscures the sensitive data before it is transmitted to the server, ensuring that the data is not stored in its original form. When redacting at the response level, ORDS obscures the sensitive data after it has been retrieved from the server and before it is sent to the client. This approach is useful when the data needs to be stored in its original form but should not be visible to the client.By providing a flexible and secure way to redact REST calls, ORDS enables and allows administrators to configure the scope of redaction and implement it at the request or response level, depending on their security requirements.", "duration": "42 minutes", "published_time": "2022-06-23T02:01:41", "title_ko": "Oracle Data Redaction\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec REST GET \ud638\ucd9c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubcf4\ud638", "description_ko": "\uac1c\uc815\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\ub824\ub0b4\uac70\ub098 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

It allows developers easily integrate pre-trained models into their applications with APIs or custom training models to meet their specific use cases. In this workshop, we will explore how to use Vision AI service to create a custom-built model to detect pneumonia infected lungs on a fresh dataset of X-ray images. Oracle Analytics is then used as a front-end tool to use the model to classify new images for pneumonia. What to expect to see in this workshop? In the first place, we will demonstrate and explore the whole process from \u201cplain\u201d X-ray image to identifying pneumonia infected lungs using OCI services:\u2022 Gathering and storing images to OCI Object Storage.\u2022 Labeling images depending on whether they represent normal or pneumonia infected lungs using Data Labeling service.\u2022 Building and training an image classification model using OCI Vision.\u2022 Registering an OCI Vision model with Oracle Analytics.\u2022 Applying a model in Oracle Analytics\u2019 Data Flows. \u2022 Visualizing everything at the end by using Oracle Analytics Data Visualization.Why is this relevant? Firstly, it shows the flexibility and usability of the OCI ecosystem, specifically Data Lakehouse services. Secondly, the whole process (with exception of data labeling which is done programmatically) is code-less, with not too many steps in the process, and the process itself is really very simple to use. This implies possibilities which can be explored by much wider range of users comparing to the situation today, where all depends on skilled developers and data scientists. And the bottom line, this can have very positive impact on business.", "duration": "4 hours", "published_time": "2022-07-14T08:20:39", "title_ko": "Analytics Cloud \ubc0f Vision AI \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud3d0\ub834\uc6a9 X\uc120 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ubd84\ub958", "description_ko": "\uc791\uc131\uc790: \u017diga Vaupot, Oracle ACE Pro - Business Intelligence, QubixVision\ub294 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uae30\ubc18 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \ube44\uc804\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 OCI \ub0b4\uc758 \uc140\ud504 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 AI \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac1c\ubc1c\uc790\ub294 API \ub610\ub294 \ucee4\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c8\uc774\uc9d5 \uad50\uc721 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uc804 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0 \uac04\ud3b8\ud558\uac8c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud2b9\uc815 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \ucda9\uc871\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc6cc\ud06c\uc0f5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Vision AI \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec X\uc120 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3d0\ub834 \uac10\uc5fc \ud3d0\ub97c \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0b4\ud3b4\ubd05\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c Oracle Analytics\ub97c \ud504\ub860\ud2b8 \uc5d4\ub4dc \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud3d0\ub834\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \ubd84\ub958\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc6cc\ud06c\uc0f5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubb34\uc5c7\uc744 \uae30\ub300\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\uae4c? \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 OCI \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \"\uc77c\ubc18\" X\uc120 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3d0\ub834 \uac10\uc5fc \ud3d0 \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\ub294 \uc804\uccb4 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uc2dc\uc5f0\ud558\uace0 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.\u2022 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c OCI Object Storage\uc5d0 \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uace0 \uc800\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.\u2022 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uac00 \uc77c\ubc18 \ub610\ub294 \ud3d0\ub834\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub808\uc774\ube14 \uc9c0\uc815 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub808\uc774\ube14\ub9c1 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac10\uc5fc\ub41c \ud3d0.\u2022 OCI Vision\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ubd84\ub958 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0 \uad50\uc721\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.\u2022 Oracle Analytics\uc5d0 OCI Vision \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub4f1\ub85d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.\u2022 Oracle Analytics\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uc5d0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \u2022 Oracle Analytics Data Visualization.Why\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc885\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uac83\uc744 \uc2dc\uac01\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uad00\ub828\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\uae4c? \uccab\uc9f8, OCI \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4, \ud2b9\ud788 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub808\uc774\ud06c\ud558\uc6b0\uc2a4 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc758 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uacfc \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ub418\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \uc9c0\uc815\uc744 \uc81c\uc678\ud558\uace0 \uc804\uccb4 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub294 \ucf54\ub4dc\uac00 \ud544\uc694 \uc5c6\uc73c\uba70 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ub108\ubb34 \ub9ce\uc740 \ub2e8\uacc4\uac00 \uc5c6\uc73c\uba70 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uc790\uccb4\ub294 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uac04\ub2e8\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc624\ub298\ub0a0\uc758 \uc0c1\ud669\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \ud6e8\uc52c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ubaa8\ub450 \uc219\ub828\ub41c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc790 \ubc0f \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uacfc\ud559\uc790\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc774\uac83\uc740 \uc0ac\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce60 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "duration_ko": "4\uc2dc\uac04", "oci_products": "ai service,x-ray image,x-ray images,analytics cloud,qubixvision,oci services,vision ai service,apis,computer", "key_phrase": "x-ray images,oracle analytics,whole process,infected lungs,pneumonia,workshop,using analytics cloud,vision ai servicesauthor,\ufffd\ufffdiga vaupot,self-service ai service"}

You will need JDK 11+, Apache Maven (3.6), and Docker installed before you begin.During this lab you will install Helidon CLI tools and develop the HTTP microservice application. For Verrazzano you will set up Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE) on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure using Oracle Cloud Free Tier account. The Free Tier account is sufficient to explore and learn how to run and operate microservice applications on an enterprise level.The goal of this workshop is that you learn the basics of using Helidon and Verrazzano and understand how they can help you in your projects. If you want to learn more about the capabilities of these projects, then continue to explore using your Oracle Free Tier cloud account and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.", "duration": "1 hour", "published_time": "2022-10-08T13:19:14", "title_ko": "Oracle Kubernetes \ud658\uacbd \ubc0f Verrazzano\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158 \uac1c\ubc1c", "description_ko": "\uc774 \uc2e4\uc2b5\uc740 \ucc38\uac00\uc790\ub4e4\uc5d0\uac8c Helidon \ubc0f Verrazzano\uc758 \uc18c\uac1c \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc2e4\uc2b5 \uc138\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5d4\ud130\ud504\ub77c\uc774\uc988 \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 platform.This\ub294 BYOL(Bring Your Own Laptop) \uc138\uc158\uc774\ubbc0\ub85c Windows, OSX \ub610\ub294 Linux \ub7a9\ud1b1\uc73c\ub85c \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uace0 \uc870\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubc30\ud3ec\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubc30\uc6c1\ub2c8\ub2e4. begin.During\ub97c \uc124\uce58\ud558\uae30 \uc804\uc5d0 JDK 11+, Apache Maven(3.6) \ubc0f Docker\uac00 \uc124\uce58\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc5b4\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc2e4\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Helidon CLI \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc124\uce58\ud558\uace0 HTTP \ub9c8\uc774\ud06c\ub85c \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

To simplify this process, many organizations are turning to containerization technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes. Docker allows for the creation of portable container images that can be deployed on any platform, while Kubernetes provides a powerful orchestration engine that can manage the deployment and scaling of containers.Oracle Verrazzano is a cloud-native platform that provides a unified management experience for deploying and operating containerized applications on Kubernetes clusters. It simplifies the deployment of complex applications by providing a consistent set of tools and APIs that can be used to manage and monitor applications across multiple clusters.In this workshop, we will explore the process of deploying a Tomcat application Docker image to an Oracle Kubernetes cluster using Verrazzano.We will cover the steps involved in creating a Docker image, configuring Verrazzano, deploying the application, and monitoring its performance.

Developers now get the flexibility and data access benefits of the JSON document model, plus the storage efficiency and power of the relational model. The new feature that enables this convergence is called JSON Relational Duality View.Interacting with your Oracle Database with HTTPS and REST APIs can be as simple as picking the objects in your database you want to start working with.Oracle REST Data Service (ORDS) includes a feature known as \u2018AutoREST,\u2019 where one or more objects are enabled, and REST API endpoints are automatically published.

Although the metadata can stored in different places, Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) can work with it whether it is stored locally (using PL/SQL,API, and the UI) or in central places in data catalogs (such as OCI DCAT and AWS Glue). ADW provides high performance when querying external data at scale. Finally, ADW provides multi-language support to process Data Lakes such as SQL, Python, R, and REST.The labs in this workshop walk you through all the steps that you need to build and access the Data Lake (Oracle Object Storage buckets) using Autonomous Database (ADB). First, you set-up the workshop environment and create the necessary resources such as a compartment, an Autonomous Database instance, and Oracle Object Storage resources. Next, evolve object storage files into meaningful business entities by defining the metadata for external data in ADB using several methods such as programmatically using PL/SQL scripts, using the Database Actions user interface in ADB, or by synchronizing with Data Catalogs (to derive the metadata) such as OCI Data Catalog and AWS Glue. Next, you can gain insights from the Data Lakes by querying data that lives in your Oracle Database and combine that with data that is stored in your Oracle Object Storage buckets using regular SQL select statements that includes joined tables. You also move data to Object Storage buckets by exporting your datasets. Finally, you query your data using the SQL Worksheet.", "duration": "2 hours, 30 minutes", "published_time": "2023-02-15T02:19:07", "title_ko": "Autonomous Data Warehouse\ub85c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub808\uc774\ud06c \uad6c\ucd95", "description_ko": "\ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 CSV, Parquet, JSON, ORC, Avro\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud615\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ub85c\uceec \ubc0f \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc\uc5d0 \uc800\uc7a5\ub418\uba70 Iceberg \ubc0f Delta Share\uc640 \uac19\uc774 \uace7 \uc81c\uacf5\ub420 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud14c\uc774\ube14 \ud615\uc2dd\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uba54\ud0c0\ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc7a5\uc18c\uc5d0 \uc800\uc7a5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc Autonomous Data Warehouse(ADW)\ub294 \ub85c\uceec\uc5d0 \uc800\uc7a5\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0(PL/SQL, API \ubc0f UI \uc0ac\uc6a9) \uc544\ub2c8\uba74 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uce74\ud0c8\ub85c\uadf8\uc758 \uc911\uc559 \uc704\uce58(\uc608: OCI DCAT \ubc0f AWS Glue)\uc5d0 \uc800\uc7a5\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0 \uc5ec\ubd80\uc5d0 \uad00\uacc4\uc5c6\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Given the speed of innovation and global outreach, it can be challenging for patients and healthcare providers to stay abreast of the latest technological advances and how they will impact the future. In this session, we will show how Artificial Intelligence (AI) with Machine Learning (ML) is helping identify breast and lung cancer with quick solutions using Oracle APEX, Autonomous Database, OCI, AI Services, and Oracle Analytics Cloud built in just four weeks. We'll share how we trained our AI Machine learning models with CT scan images to identify both breast and lung cancers and even incorporated features to help doctors or patients dictate medical symptoms and diagnoses quickly by sending an email of the audio message along with the medical transcription text. If doctors or nurses aren't available, we'll show you how digital assistants can advise patients with health concerns, answer questions about symptoms, and even locate the nearest hospital. Researchers & data enthusiasts can also analyse extensive data using open research datasets to accelerate early disease detection and prevention for better Health.", "duration": "4 hours", "published_time": "2023-03-23T09:30:17", "title_ko": "\uba38\uc2e0 \ub7ec\ub2dd \ubc0f \uc778\uacf5 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc758\ub8cc \ud601\uc2e0", "description_ko": "ML \ubc0f AI \ud234\uc740 \uc804\ub840 \uc5c6\uc774 \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub358 \uc758\ub8cc \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud601\uc2e0\uacfc \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ub3c4\ub2ec\uc758 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \uac10\uc548\ud560 \ub54c \ud658\uc790\uc640 \uc758\ub8cc \uc81c\uacf5\uc790\uac00 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uae30\uc220 \ubc1c\uc804\uacfc \ubbf8\ub798\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294\uc9c0 \ud30c\uc545\ud558\uae30\uac00 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b8 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc138\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uba38\uc2e0 \ub7ec\ub2dd(ML)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c AI(\uc778\uacf5 \uc9c0\ub2a5)\uac00 4\uc8fc \ub9cc\uc5d0 \uad6c\ucd95\ub41c Oracle APEX, Autonomous Database, OCI, AI Services \ubc0f Oracle Analytics Cloud\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ube60\ub978 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ubc29\uc554\uacfc \ud3d0\uc554\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc774 \ub418\ub294\uc9c0 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc720\ubc29\uc554\uacfc \ud3d0\uc554\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 CT \uc2a4\uce94 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub85c AI \uba38\uc2e0 \ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad50\uc721\ud558\uace0 \uc758\uc0ac\ub098 \ud658\uc790\uac00 \uc758\ub8cc \uc99d\uc0c1\uc744 \uc9c0\uc2dc\ud558\uace0 \uc758\ub8cc \uc804\uc0ac \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \uc624\ub514\uc624 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\uc758 \uc774\uba54\uc77c\uc744 \ubcf4\ub0b4 \uc2e0\uc18d\ud558\uac8c \uc9c4\ub2e8\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uacf5\uc720\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc758\uc0ac \ub610\ub294 \uac04\ud638\uc0ac\uac00 \uc81c\uacf5\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc5b4\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud134\ud2b8\uac00 \uac74\uac15 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ud658\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \uc870\uc5b8\ud558\uace0 \uc99d\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub300\ub2f5\ud558\uba70 \uac00\uc7a5 \uac00\uae4c\uc6b4 \ubcd1\uc6d0\uc744 \ucc3e\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c\uc6d0 \ubc0f \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub9e4\ub2c8\uc544\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \uc5f0\uad6c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \uc870\uae30 \uc9c8\ubcd1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uac74\uac15\uc744 \uc608\ubc29\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "duration_ko": "4\uc2dc\uac04", "oci_products": "autonomous database,oracle analytics cloud,oracle apex,healthcare,oci,artificial intelligenceml,ai services,ai tools", "key_phrase": "machine learning,healthcare innovations,artificial intelligenceml,ai tools,modern healthcare,innovation and global outreach,patients and healthcare providers,latest technological advances,artificial intelligence,breast and lung cancer"}
